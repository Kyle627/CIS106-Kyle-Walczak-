# CIS 106 Kyle Walczak

## Assignment 1

I am taking this class because it is one of the building blocks for my degree. I am studying computer science. A more interesting answer would be why I decided to study computer science. While serving in the marine corps I worked on the F-35B. I was an avionics technician and learned everything I could about the aircraft’s electronics. I did not understand how the onboard computers were communicating with the various systems or how it was able to fuse so much information and guide the pilot in decision-making for their safety. I currently am working on aircraft parts, expanding my electrical skills and expertise. With a computer science degree, I am hoping to have a well-rounded set of tools for the ever-advancing technology world.   

## Assignment 2 

My first week of programming went fairly smoothly. I got a piece of the tedious nature that programming requires. I learned about program design and the planning steps required for
programming. I think working with flow charts will be an interesting piece to the class. I’ve worked with schematics for the last seven years so I relate flow charts to schematics however; for computer programs rather than electronics. Messing around with source code language from my flow chart showed me how the syntax changes between languages without changing the output. I learned what an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is and how to use one. The IDE I used was recommended, GDB online debugger. I plan to continue to use this IDE.

## Assignment 3

This assignment taught me how to use data from the program user. I was having trouble with combing the converted age with a string but have since learned how to concatenate items together. The next issue that occurred was my output spacing. The spacing on my output msg was not correct, I had to manually add spaces inside the quotation marks. I learned how to use basic arithmetic within my program to convert a dog’s age from human years to puppy years. I used the Pascal case to label my variables as I find this easier to read than the Camel case. I intend to use these tools throughout this class and further into my programming career.

## Assignment 4

During this session, I got my first taste of programming with Python without using flow charts to generate the code for me. This unit has been interesting and very interactive. I am looking forward to coding more with Python. I experimented with floats instead of integer data types and came across some issues. Initially, I wanted a float for the initial input to allow more flexibility. I changed all data types to float and received excessive numbers beyond the decimal point. Bringing all the conversions to integers while leaving the input as a float worked the best. I plan to use this knowledge throughout this course and eventually to help secure a job for my future career. 

## Assignment 5

During this session, I had a lot of trouble with functions. My return values were not saving into my main function. I have yet to turn in a flow chart or source code because of this. I will continue to try before submitting it. I hope that with all this trouble, the knowledge that I gain will stick with me and I don't make these mistakes in the future. I am looking forward to using standard libraries and discovering what all they contain. Moving forward I would like to use these new tools throughout the rest of this course and further into my programming career. 

## Assignment 6

During this assignment I learned about the importance of passing parameters through my processing and output functions. I also experienced trouble with concatenating strings and integers. It was interesting using the same activity, as you can see the difference from assignment to assignment. Using functions seems to make your main program extremely simple to read. One thing that would improve my programs is knowing how to change precision. I would prefer some variables without decimals, but Python adds them regardless. I am excited to learn about standard libraries and use already made functions in my programs. I plan to use these tools throughout this programming course and hopefully further into my programming career.  

## Assignment 7 

During this session, I learned about conditionals. Using the conditionals were a bit tricky but eventually everything worked fine. I also learned about assignment verses equality. This session went over fairly smoothly, structed programming taught me how to write cleaner code to avoid spaghetti code. Using my first else/if/elif statement was interesting cause prior to this assignment everything was straight forward without any room for the operator to make selections. I learned that relationship operators yield Boolean values depending on the relationship of operands. This was interesting to think about, it's common sense after all pieces together but definitely interesting to learn.

## Assignment 8

During this session, I learned about For loops. I had trouble with my counter at first but learned from an external source on how to do it. The book instructed the use of "counter" but every time I had the word counter in my code I received a syntax error. I learned about how little code can produce a lot. Previously our assignments had us write a bit of code to output very little, this assignment has less code than the last but can output a lot more. I also learned about increment and decrement and was able to successfully use an increment in my code. 

## Assignment 9

During this session, I learned about while loops. Again, issues with the counter were occurring. During this session, I was able to use the word "counter" without getting an error. Initially, I had trouble thinking about averaging the scores without returning the individual scores. After that, the code seemed to run fine. I attempted to use Thonny IDE for the first time however, with network restrictions my work computer was unable to download the local version. I plan to install Thonny on my personal computer to gain more experience with other IDEs. I am excited to move on to the next style of loops. 

## Assignment 10

During this session, I learned more about loops. This assignment seemed to go the smoothest out of our loop assignments. I am not sure if that is because of practice or because it is a similar code to the previous assignment. I used GBD online to help debug my code. The biggest issue I had with this assignment was using the incorrect operator to divide two tuples. I had this issue because a tuple was never supposed to be produced. I fixed this by having total and counter defined with the same function, at one time. Whereas before I would define the total then, on the next line, define the counter. This causes tuple data types and does not process in the intended manner.

## Assignment 11

During this session, I got my first taste of arrays.  Although I sneaked a preview last week, when I was having trouble totaling the scores, entered. I had a lot of trouble with having the input of months correspond to the correct array index. I used a combination of GBD online IDE and Thonny, as half of my code was done while at work and I do not have access to Thonny there. The next thing I had trouble with was properly calculating the leap years. At first, my code wasn't editing the array it would just output the original value. With some external sources, I learned how to replace variables in an array using the .insert(). This assignment was more frustrating than previous assignments because we never had to account for user input errors until now.  

## Assignment 12

During this session, I got my second look at arrays. Using an array seems like it has a lot of uses especially when you get into dynamic arrays, basically making an Excel sheet behind the scenes. I used Thonny IDE and plan to continue using this IDE when available. I had issues with actually storing the test scores in the array and would output "none" until I assigned the input to a spot in the array, once that was resolved the code seemed to run fine. This assignment allows the user to determine the size of the array, something we haven't done yet. Defitenely interesting taking different routes with the program.  

## Assignment 13

During this session, I used string functions. The two functions I used were split() and strip(). The split function was the first of the two and it takes a string and split is into multiple pieces, creating an ilst. The next, strip, was used to remove extra whitespaces from the new set of variables in the list. I used Thonny for the entirety of this assignment and plan to continue using it moving forward. My one struggle with this assignment was using an f string without a placeholder. I changed this to a regular print line and the variables were showing prior to user input as "none". Once that was resolved to program seemed to run fine.
