## Assignment 1

I am taking this class because it is one of the building blocks for my degree. I am studying computer science. A more interesting answer would be why I decided to study computer science. While serving in the marine corps I worked on the F-35B. I was an avionics technician and learned everything I could about the aircraft’s electronics. I did not understand how the onboard computers were communicating with the various systems or how it was able to fuse so much information and guide the pilot in decision-making for their safety. I currently am working on aircraft parts, expanding my electrical skills and expertise. With a computer science degree, I am hoping to have a well-rounded set of tools for the ever-advancing technology world.   

## Assignment 2 

My first week of programming went fairly smoothly. I got a piece of the tedious nature that programming requires. I learned about program design and the planning steps required for
programming. I think working with flow charts will be an interesting piece to the class. I’ve worked with schematics for the last seven years so I relate flow charts to schematics however; for computer programs rather than electronics. Messing around with source code language from my flow chart showed me how the syntax changes between languages without changing the output. I learned what an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is and how to use one. The IDE I used was recommended, GDB online debugger. I plan to continue to use this IDE.

## Assignment 3

This assignment taught me how to use data from the program user. I was having trouble with combing the converted age with a string but have since learned how to concatenate items together. The next issue that occurred was my output spacing. The spacing on my output msg was not correct, I had to manually add spaces inside the quotation marks. I learned how to use basic arithmetic within my program to convert a dog’s age from human years to puppy years. I used the Pascal case to label my variables as I find this easier to read than the Camel case. I intend to use these tools throughout this class and further into my programming career.

## Assignment 4

During this session, I got my first taste of programming with Python without using flow charts to generate the code for me. This unit has been interesting and very interactive. I am looking forward to coding more with Python. I experimented with floats instead of integer data types and came across some issues. Initially, I wanted a float for the initial input to allow more flexibility. I changed all data types to float and received excessive numbers beyond the decimal point. Bringing all the conversions to integers while leaving the input as a float worked the best. I plan to use this knowledge throughout this course and eventually to help secure a job for my future career.
