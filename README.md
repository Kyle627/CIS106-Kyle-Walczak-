# CIS 106 Kyle Walczak

## Assignment 1

I am taking this class because it is one of the building blocks for my degree. I am studying computer science. A more interesting answer would be why I decided to study computer science. While serving in the marine corps I worked on the F-35B. I was an avionics technician and learned everything I could about the aircraftâ€™s electronics. I did not understand how the onboard computers were communicating with the various systems or how it was able to fuse so much information and guide the pilot in decision-making for their safety. I currently am working on aircraft parts, expanding my electrical skills and expertise. With a computer science degree, I am hoping to have a well-rounded set of tools for the ever-advancing technology world.
