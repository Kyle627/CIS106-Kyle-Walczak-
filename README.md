## Assignment 1

I am taking this class because it is one of the building blocks for my degree. I am studying computer science. A more interesting answer would be why I decided to study computer science. While serving in the marine corps I worked on the F-35B. I was an avionics technician and learned everything I could about the aircraft’s electronics. I did not understand how the onboard computers were communicating with the various systems or how it was able to fuse so much information and guide the pilot in decision-making for their safety. I currently am working on aircraft parts, expanding my electrical skills and expertise. With a computer science degree, I am hoping to have a well-rounded set of tools for the ever-advancing technology world.   

## Assignment 2 

My first week of programming went fairly smoothly. I got a piece of the tedious nature that programming requires. I learned about program design and the planning steps required for
programming. I think working with flow charts will be an interesting piece to the class. I’ve worked with schematics for the last seven years so I relate flow charts to schematics however; for computer programs rather than electronics. I learned what an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is and how to use one. The IDE I used was recommended, GDB online debugger. I plan to continue to use this IDE.
