## Assignment 1

I am taking this class because it is one of the building blocks for my degree. I am studying computer science. A more interesting answer would be why I decided to study computer science. While serving in the marine corps I worked on the F-35B. I was an avionics technician and learned everything I could about the aircraft’s electronics. I did not understand how the onboard computers were communicating with the various systems or how it was able to fuse so much information and guide the pilot in decision-making for their safety. I currently am working on aircraft parts, expanding my electrical skills and expertise. With a computer science degree, I am hoping to have a well-rounded set of tools for the ever-advancing technology world.   

## Assignment 2 

My first week of programming went fairly smoothly. I got a piece of the tedious nature that programming requires. I learned about program design and the planning steps required for
programming. I think working with flow charts will be an interesting piece to the class. I’ve worked with schematics for the last seven years so I relate flow charts to schematics however; for computer programs rather than electronics. Messing around with source code language from my flow chart showed me how the syntax changes between languages without changing the output. I learned what an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is and how to use one. The IDE I used was recommended, GDB online debugger. I plan to continue to use this IDE.

## Assignment 3

This assignment taught me how to use data from the program user. I was having trouble with combing the converted age with a string but have since learned how to concatenate items together. The next issue that occurred was my output spacing. The spacing on my output msg was not correct, I had to manually add spaces inside the quotation marks. I learned how to use basic arithmetic within my program to convert a dog’s age from human years to puppy years. I used the Pascal case to label my variables as I find this easier to read than the Camel case. I intend to use these tools throughout this class and further into my programming career.

## Assignment 4

During this session, I got my first taste of programming with Python without using flow charts to generate the code for me. This unit has been interesting and very interactive. I am looking forward to coding more with Python. I experimented with floats instead of integer data types and came across some issues. Initially, I wanted a float for the initial input to allow more flexibility. I changed all data types to float and received excessive numbers beyond the decimal point. Bringing all the conversions to integers while leaving the input as a float worked the best. I plan to use this knowledge throughout this course and eventually to help secure a job for my future career. 

## Assignment 5

During this session, I had a lot of trouble with functions. My return values were not saving into my main function. I have yet to turn in a flow chart or source code because of this. I will continue to try before submitting it. I hope that with all this trouble, the knowledge that I gain will stick with me and I don't make these mistakes in the future. I am looking forward to using standard libraries and discovering what all they contain. Moving forward I would like to use these new tools throughout the rest of this course and further into my programming career. 

## Assignment 6

During this assignment I learned about the importance of passing parameters through my processing and output functions. I also experienced trouble with concatenating strings and integers. It was interesting using the same activity, as you can see the difference from assignment to assignment. Using functions seems to make your main program extremely simple to read. One thing that would improve my programs is knowing how to change precision. I would prefer some variables without decimals, but python adds them regardless. I am excited to learn about standard libraries and use already made functions in my programs. I plan to use these tools throughout this programming course and hopefully further into my programming career.
